h2.tranSVG


h3.SVG l10n helper


This small piece of software is primarily aimed at translators and l10n teams who work with SVG files. This may be useful for diagrams, infographics, charts and so on.


Main (future) features include:
* parse SVG files as XML and identify l10n strings
* isolate strings and create some sort of catalogs, similar to PO files
* offer a working GUI to translators, maybe similar to poedit [1]
* create an unlimited number of different translations based on the catalog file
* export the translations back to SVG files


[1]: http://www.poedit.net/


Software dependencies:
* python 2.7
* gettext (not yet implemented)
* any .po files editor (I recommend poedit)


Required Python modules:
* lxml
* elementtree (both are in tests now, only one will survive)
* re
* pprint (optional, only for testing purposes)



Of course, having an automated tool translate some strings may end up in a messy design, especially when translating to German or other verbose language. Keep in mind that you may need to review and tweak the design a bit if you want to make sure it's still usable!


h4.Release date for v0.1: June, maybe
